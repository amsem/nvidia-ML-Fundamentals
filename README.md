# Fundamentals of Deep Learning

## Learning Objectives
By participating in this is workshop, I have :

Learned the fundamental techniques and tools required to train a deep learning model
Gained experience with common deep learning data types and model architectures
Enhanced datasets through data augmentation to improve model accuracy
Leveraged transfer learning between models to achieve efficient results with less data and computation
Built confidence to take on my own project with a modern deep learning framework

## Details :
The workshop was healed by MR Abdelghani KABOT Nvidia Intructor.
This Repository contanis a .ipynb file of my final assesment the images doesn't apear because the code was executed on the cloud with Jupyter notebook (AWS Instance).
Also contains the certificate of completion delivered by Nvidia. 




### The Workshop took place 02/11/2022 in hour University Lab and was 8 Hours long
